# agentic-rpa-document-orchestrator
My project introduces an agentic AI layer above traditional RPA systems. Instead of fixed workflows, the AI agent interprets user goals, plans execution strategies, dynamically selects RPA bots, and adapts to failures. This makes automation more flexible and intelligent.
# Abstract
Traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems operate on static, rule-based workflows and require manual intervention whenever task requirements or execution environments change. This limits their adaptability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, this project proposes an Agentic AI–Driven Intelligent RPA Task Orchestrator, which integrates an autonomous AI agent with RPA workflows to enable dynamic decision-making and task execution.

The proposed system introduces an agentic layer capable of interpreting high-level user goals, planning execution strategies, and invoking appropriate RPA bots based on contextual understanding. Instead of predefined linear workflows, the AI agent reasons about the task, selects relevant automation components, monitors execution, and adapts to failures by triggering alternative actions or recovery mechanisms.

The system is implemented using Python-based AI orchestration, Large Language Model (LLM) APIs for reasoning and planning, and RPA workflows developed using standard automation tools. Execution logs and agent decisions are recorded to ensure transparency and traceability. This approach enhances automation flexibility, reduces human dependency, and improves resilience against process variations.

The outcome of this project is a functional prototype demonstrating how agentic intelligence can augment traditional RPA systems, paving the way for more adaptive and autonomous enterprise automation solutions.
